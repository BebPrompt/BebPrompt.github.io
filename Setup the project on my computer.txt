Hey AI, I need you to help me set up my computer for coding a web application fast, using a specific set of tools that I’ve chosen for their simplicity and efficiency. Here’s what we’re going to use and why, so you can set it up for me step-by-step.
First, we’re installing Node.js. This is a must-have because it lets us run JavaScript outside of a browser, which is key for both development and deployment. Think of it as the engine that powers our tools and processes. Node.js comes with npm, a package manager that’ll let us easily grab and manage libraries we need. I want this because it simplifies running JavaScript on my machine and later on a server, making everything from setup to live deployment smooth.
Next, we’re setting up Next.js. This is our main framework for both the front-end and back-end—yep, one tool for both! On the front-end, Next.js will handle what users see, turning our JavaScript code into HTML pages that browsers can display. I love it because it skips the hassle of writing raw HTML by hand and automates that process. For the back-end, it gives us a serverless setup for APIs and logic, so we don’t have to mess with managing a full server ourselves. I’m using Next.js because it’s a single, streamlined solution that keeps my workflow simple and fast, all in JavaScript.
For the front-end specifically, I’m pairing Next.js with React, a JavaScript library that’s great for building reusable UI components like buttons and forms. It’s efficient and flexible, which is why I’m using it—plus, Next.js is built on top of React, so they work seamlessly together. To make styling easier, I’m adding Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI. Tailwind lets me style things quickly with utility classes, and Daisy UI gives me pre-made components like buttons and tables, so I don’t have to design everything from scratch. These save me time and keep my app looking good without much effort.
On the back-end, Next.js will handle our API routes—those invisible parts that manage business logic, like processing payments or user data. I’m also using MongoDB as my database because it’s simple to set up and works well with JavaScript, storing all my app’s data efficiently. This combo is perfect because it keeps everything in one language (JavaScript) and avoids the complexity of learning multiple systems.

Here’s how I want you to set it up:
Install Node.js: We should have this installed already but please verify. This gives us the runtime and npm. Check it worked by running node -v and npm -v in the terminal to see the versions.

Install Next.js: Use npm to create a Next.js project. In my terminal run npx create-next-app@latest. When it prompts, name the project to match our project, say yes to ESLint and the App Router, and no to TypeScript or SRC directory unless I say otherwise. This sets up a ready-to-go Next.js project with React included.

Add Front-End Tools: Inside the project, install Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI with npm. Run npm install -D tailwindcss and set it up following Next.js docs, then run npm install daisyui and add it to the Tailwind config. This gets my styling tools ready.

Back-End Prep: For now, Next.js handles the API side, so no extra setup there yet. For MongoDB, we’ll add it later when we need a database, but keep it in mind as our storage solution.

Once this is done, I want to test it. In the terminal, inside my project folder, run npm run dev to start a local development server. Then I will open my browser to localhost:3000 to see the default Next.js page. That’ll confirm everything’s working.

That’s the plan! I’m using Node.js for the JavaScript runtime, Next.js for a unified front-end and back-end framework, React for UI components, Tailwind and Daisy UI for styling, and MongoDB for data—all because they’re efficient, mostly free, and keep me in JavaScript land. Set it up like I described, and let me know when it’s ready.
