Break down the SaaS app we’re building into detailed, actionable components based on my proven method for creating internet businesses, focusing on action and delivering a structured plan.
Your task is to create a comprehensive project breakdown for an app with user accounts, payment processing, core features, and analytics, ready for execution.

Here’s what to do:
Define the project as the SaaS app we discussed, including a landing page, user dashboard, a form for the app’s main feature, payment integration, and usage tracking.

Break it into components:
Frontend: 
Landing page (app/page.js): Hero section, features, contact form.

Dashboard (app/dashboard/page.js): Displays user data and payment status.

Feature form (components/FeatureForm.js): Form for the app’s core action (e.g., adding data).

Backend: 
Auth API (app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js): Handles login/signup with Auth.js and Google.

Feature API (app/api/feature/route.js): POST to save user data to MongoDB, GET to fetch data.

Payment API (app/api/stripe-checkout/route.js): Creates Stripe checkout session for premium access.

Webhook API (app/api/stripe-webhook/route.js): Listens for Stripe events (e.g., checkout.session.completed) to update user access.

Email API (app/api/email/route.js): Sends welcome email via Resend after signup.

Analytics: DataDog integration (app/layout.js): Tracks page views and feature usage.

Deployment: Vercel setup (vercel.json): Configures routing and environment.

For each component, provide:
File name (e.g., app/page.js).

Functionality (e.g., ‘Renders landing page with contact form submitting to /api/email’).

Dependencies (e.g., ‘Uses Resend for email, MongoDB for data storage’).

Organize into a Next.js directory structure: app/, components/, lib/ (for MongoDB utils), public/.

Generate a JSON file (project-breakdown.json) with this structure, including all details.

Output Format: Deliver a project-breakdown.json file with the directory structure and component details, ready to guide the build. Provide only the plan.
