I need you to prepare a detailed tech stack setup for building the SaaS app we’re working on, using the exact tools and versions I specify below.
Your task is to provide a complete list of technologies and a ready-to-use package.json file for a Node.js project, focusing on action and delivering the finished setup.

Here’s what to do:
Use the following tech stack:
Language: JavaScript for both frontend and backend, to keep it simple and unified.

Frontend: React (latest stable version) for reusable components, Next.js (latest stable) as the framework for organizing pages and rendering, Tailwind CSS (latest) for styling, and Daisy UI (latest) for pre-built UI components like buttons and tables.

Backend: Next.js for API routes (handling business logic), MongoDB (Community Edition, latest) for storing data related to the app’s features.

Third-Party Services: Auth.js (latest) for user authentication (e.g., login with Google), Resend (latest) for sending emails, Stripe (latest SDK) for processing payments (subscriptions and one-time), DataDog (latest client) for web analytics to track user activity.

Provide a list of these technologies with their exact names and purposes (e.g., ‘Next.js - Frontend framework and API routes’).

Generate a package.json file including:
Dependencies: react, react-dom, next, tailwindcss, daisyui, mongodb, @auth/core, resend, @stripe/stripe-js, stripe, @datadog/browser-rum.

Dev dependencies: eslint (for linting), @next/eslint-plugin-next (Next.js linting rules).

Scripts: "dev": "next dev", "build": "next build", "start": "next start", "lint": "eslint ." (standard Next.js setup).

Set Node.js version to the latest LTS (e.g., 20.x.x as of March 25, 2025) in the engines field.

Do not deviate from these tools or add others—just deliver the specified stack for the app we’re building.

Output Format: Deliver a tech stack list and a complete package.json file, ready to initialize with npm install. Provide only the finished result.
