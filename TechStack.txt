"Hey AI, here’s the tech stack we’re going to use for building this project, along with why I’ve chosen each part. I want you to stick to this setup for consistency and efficiency, as it’s the same stack I rely on for all my apps. Let’s make this clear and actionable.
Programming Language: JavaScript  
Why: I’m using JavaScript because it’s versatile and lets me handle both the front end and back end with a single language. This keeps things simple, so I don’t have to juggle multiple languages like Python or C++. It’s fast to learn and widely supported, which suits our goal of coding quickly.

Front End: React with Next.js  
Why: For the front end—what users see—I’m going with React because it’s great for building reusable components like buttons and forms. I’m pairing it with Next.js as the framework because it organizes pages easily, handles both front-end rendering and back-end logic, and simplifies deployment. This combo speeds up development by generating HTML from JavaScript automatically.

Styling: Tailwind CSS with Daisy UI  
Why: I’m using Tailwind CSS to style the app since it makes writing clean, reusable styles quick and intuitive. I’m adding Daisy UI on top because it provides pre-built components like buttons and tables, saving me from designing everything from scratch. Together, they make the app look good fast.

Back End: Next.js API Routes  
Why: For the back end—the invisible logic—I’m using Next.js again with its built-in API routes. This keeps everything in one framework, avoiding the hassle of managing separate tools. It’s serverless by default, so I don’t have to worry about setting up a full server, which saves time.

Database: MongoDB  
Why: I’m picking MongoDB to store data because it’s flexible, easy to set up, and works well with JavaScript. It’s perfect for quickly saving and retrieving user info or app data without complex configurations.

Third-Party Tools:  
Auth: Auth.js - Simplifies login with Google and other providers, keeping authentication straightforward.  

Emails: Resend - Makes sending emails across the app reliable and easy.  

Payments: Stripe (or Lemon Squeezy) - Handles subscriptions and one-time payments smoothly, with great developer tools.  

Analytics: Datafast - Tracks who’s visiting the site, giving me useful insights without extra complexity.  

Why: These tools are mostly free to start, integrate well with my stack, and handle common tasks so I can focus on coding the core app.

Why This Stack Overall:
This setup is my go-to because it’s almost free, fast to work with, and lets me reuse the same tools across projects. Sticking to one stack means less time learning new things and more time shipping apps. Everything here—JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind, MongoDB, and these third-party services—works together seamlessly to build full internet businesses efficiently. Now, let’s use this to code something awesome!"
