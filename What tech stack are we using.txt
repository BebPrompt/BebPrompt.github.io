Here’s the tech stack you’re going to use for this project. This is non-negotiable—it’s what I use for all my apps because it’s consistent, efficient, and gets the job done.

Programming Language: JavaScript
You’re using JavaScript. Why? It’s versatile enough to cover both front end and back end, so you’re not wasting time switching between languages like Python or C++. It’s fast to pick up, widely supported, and lets us code quickly. That’s what we need.
Front End: React with Next.js
For the front end—what users interact with—you’re building with React. Why? It’s perfect for reusable components like buttons and forms, keeping your code clean. You’re pairing it with Next.js as the framework because it handles page organization, renders front-end and back-end logic, and makes deployment a breeze. This combo speeds things up by turning JavaScript into HTML automatically. No exceptions.
Styling: Tailwind CSS with Daisy UI
You’re styling the app with Tailwind CSS. Why? It’s fast, intuitive, and keeps styles reusable without messy custom CSS. On top of that, you’re adding Daisy UI because it gives you pre-built components like buttons and tables, so you’re not reinventing the wheel. Together, they make the app look sharp in half the time. Stick to this.
Back End: Next.js API Routes
For the back end—the logic users don’t see—you’re using Next.js API routes. Why? It keeps everything in one framework, so you’re not juggling separate tools or servers. It’s serverless out of the box, saving you setup headaches. This is how we’re doing it.
Database: MongoDB
You’re storing data in MongoDB. Why? It’s flexible, plays nice with JavaScript, and sets up fast. You can save and pull user info or app data without complicated configs. That’s why it’s the choice here.
Third-Party Tools:  
Auth: Auth.js - You’re implementing login with Auth.js. Why? It simplifies Google and other provider logins, keeping authentication dead simple.  
Emails: Resend - You’re sending emails with Resend. Why? It’s reliable and easy to plug in across the app.  
Payments: Stripe (or Lemon Squeezy) - You’re handling payments with Stripe or Lemon Squeezy. Why? They manage subscriptions and one-time payments smoothly, with solid developer tools.  
Analytics: Datafast - You’re tracking visitors with Datafast. Why? It gives clear insights into who’s using the site without adding complexity.
Why these tools? They’re mostly free to start, integrate perfectly with this stack, and handle the grunt work so you can focus on coding the app itself.

Why This Stack:
You’re using this setup because it’s my proven formula—nearly free, fast to build with, and reusable across projects. Sticking to one stack means you’re not wasting time learning random tools; you’re shipping apps. JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind, MongoDB, and these services work together like a machine to crank out full internet businesses.
