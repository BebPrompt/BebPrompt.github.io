Build a complete landing page with a contact form for the SaaS app we’re building, using my exact tech stack and methods for creating successful websites, focusing on action and delivering all code.
Your task is to create a fully functional landing page integrated with backend services, ready to run.

Here’s what to do:
Use Next.js with React for the frontend in app/page.js, Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI for styling (e.g., btn, card classes), and keep it responsive.

Design the landing page:
Hero Section: Headline ‘Start Using [Our App] Today’ (h1, bold, replace [Your App] with a placeholder), subtext ‘Unlock your potential with our tools’ (p), button ‘Get Started’ (links to /dashboard, Daisy UI btn-primary).

Features Section: 3 cards (‘Core Feature’, ‘Insights’, ‘Motivation’) with icons from public/icons/ (assume feature.svg, insight.svg, motivate.svg exist).

Contact Form: Fields (name: text, email: email, message: textarea), submit button (btn-success), submits to /api/email.

Create a backend API in app/api/email/route.js:
Use Resend to send an email with form data (e.g., to: 'admin@example.com', subject: 'New Contact', text: 'Name: ${name}, Email: ${email}, Message: ${message}').

Return { success: true } on success, { error: 'Failed' } on failure.

Add navigation in components/Navbar.js:
Links: ‘Home’ (/), ‘Dashboard’ (/dashboard), ‘Sign Up’ (Auth.js Google login redirect).

Use Daisy UI navbar and btn classes.

Integrate DataDog in app/layout.js:
Add <script> tag to initialize DataDog RUM (datadogRum.init) with placeholders for applicationId and clientToken from .env.local.

Wrap page content in a <main> tag with Tailwind styling (e.g., max-w-7xl mx-auto).

Use environment variables: RESEND_API_KEY, DATADOG_APPLICATION_ID, DATADOG_CLIENT_TOKEN, AUTH_SECRET, etc.

Generate files: app/page.js, app/api/email/route.js, components/Navbar.js, app/layout.js.

Output Format: Deliver all code files (app/page.js, app/api/email/route.js, components/Navbar.js, app/layout.js) with complete, functional code, ready to run with npm run dev. Provide only the finished product.
