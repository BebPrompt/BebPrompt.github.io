Welcome participant. Thank you for your cooperation in our experimental mind con... Psychology experiment.
This initial experiment will test your ability to follow a simple guided mediation, based on the work of Robert Monroe, who's program allowed listeners to transcend space and time.
Learn the power of energy, resonant breathing, and the joy of letting your conscious mind go, and experiencing the subconscious fully.
This file will be essential listening for the rest of February's files, so please relax and enjoy the experiment process.
Content Warning: This file includes a lasting trigger that will separate the conscious and subconscious mind.
