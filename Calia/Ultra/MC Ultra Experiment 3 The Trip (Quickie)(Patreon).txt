This file uses triggers from the previous two MC Ultra files. Please listen to them before continuing.
In this experiment, you will be subjected to a mental barrage of words, suggestions, and commands that are intended to overwhelm your senses and produce unexpected, and fantastical results. This file is intended to simulate the experience of a trip, to understand the effect of human sexuality on perception.
Be advised, at this point you are highly suggestible and susceptible to the effects of these files. Proceed with caution, participant.
Content Warning: This file includes distortion of reality, and similar content to the previous experiment in the series. Please do not listen if you feel anxious. Please do not listen under the influence.Â Includes amnesia trigger.
