If you've missed any of the MC Ultra series, please go back and listen, as they include triggers that are essential for this file.
This final experiment will use the learnings from our previous work to make you more useful to us, participant. You'll find yourself being re-programmed to better fit our needs. However, you will not be allowed to understand or know them. That information is classified.
This file will be a pleasurable, but dangerous experience, participant, but we know you're up to the challenge. Congratulations on coming to the conclusion of the MC Ultra program. Don't worry, you won't remember a thing.
Content Warning: This file includes all previous commands and triggers. It includes post suggestion and amnesia triggers.
