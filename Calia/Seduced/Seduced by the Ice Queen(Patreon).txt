It's that time of year, that cold, snowy, frozen time. But you're out in the frozen landscape wandering in the snow. Foolish, but lucky for you there's an old castle, and someone lives there. You're safe from the Ice Queen there, surely?
Maybe you can shelter with the kindly woman who lives there... before you continue your quest to save the Princess from that awful Ice Queen... But can you really trust this woman who seems very willing to use her hypnosis to have you frozen in place? Or should you let it go, and be with her?
A gentle femdom roleplay that's sure to have you feeling chills!
