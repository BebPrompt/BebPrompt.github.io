You're free to leave my cult at any time. You know that, don't you? But you really do need to be sure, to understand why you'd want to do that. I offer so, so much to you, such delight, such bliss.
Why would you want to leave that? Though you're free to do so if you wish. Perhaps you want to resist... or accept my teachings and power.
Either way, this experience will bring you pleasure untold as you prepare yourself for the final stage of the Cult, the path from apprentice to zealot.
