I recorded this for
DESCENT
, but I wanted to share it with you lovely patrons too now it's been on rotation for a while. If you haven't heard it yet, it's really meant as an intro to my voice and style for newcomers, but I think it's a nice file.
It's also aimed at people who have a tough time with trance, so if that's you, I'd love to know how it made you feel!
This is fully safe for work, non-erotic, just pure trance
