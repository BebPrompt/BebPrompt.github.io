Welcome to the femdom obsession series. This journey will turn you into a completely mindless submissive for powerful women, and most importantly, for me.
In part one you learned the path to subspace, a place where you can be relaxed and completely open. Now it's time to learn what it means to be a good submissive. Relax, listen, and enjoy.
Best listened to immediately after the previous session. Contains themes of dominance and submission.
Content Warning: This series is designed to increase your interest in femdom. It will include safety elements in a later file that ensures the triggers, as they are developed, cannot be used maliciously. Specifically, in part 3. The themes this series will touch on will include a myriad of femdom-related kinks, and I would recommend you create your own playlist of the files that suit you, rather than listening as a whole. If you need to, listen to my trigger removal file to reset yourself. Many of these files include amnesia triggers.
