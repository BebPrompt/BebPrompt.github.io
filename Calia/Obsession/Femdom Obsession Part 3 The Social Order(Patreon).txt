In part three of the series, you'll be reminded how the world works, who runs our society really... and why dominant women deserve your obedience and servitude!
This file also allows others to use the triggers in this series, and introduces some safety elements to ensure they won't be used maliciously. You can share your training with a domme or partner, and give them the chance to use these triggers on you as they are developed further over the coming months.
Best listened to immediately after the previous session.
Content Warning: This series is designed to increase your interest in femdom. It will include safety elements in a later file that ensures the triggers, as they are developed, cannot be used maliciously. Specifically, in part 3. The themes this series will touch on will include a myriad of femdom-related kinks, and I would recommend you create your own playlist of the files that suit you, rather than listening as a whole. If you need to, listen to my trigger removal file to reset yourself. Many of these files include amnesia triggers.
