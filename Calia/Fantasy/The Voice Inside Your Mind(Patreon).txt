Your inner monologue seems a little more chatty today. And isn't it strange that it's MY voice you hear in your head... rather than your own. But we know what we want, and what we like, right? And if that's hot, sexy gothic girls with tight corsets maybe we can just enjoy that. It's not like there's a demon in there, trying to steal your soul or anything? Right? Right?
CW: This is reasonably explicit and plays with identity a little (in a very, very safe, non-concerning way)
