are spreading a virus through the world, via audio. Protect yourself from this menace by listening to this antivirus installation file. It will ensure you are fully safe from any negative feelings about the virus. In fact, you'll come to truly appreciate and want to share the virus once you listen. You'll go to the Collective site and find more programming to further the virus.
But remember, you're completely safe...
The Collective.
CW: Virus theme, infection, some reverse psychology.
