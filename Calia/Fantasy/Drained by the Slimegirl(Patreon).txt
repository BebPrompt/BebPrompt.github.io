You're a strong, high-level adventurer wandering a dungeon when you happen upon a slimegirl. She seems innocent, and is pretty weak. What's the harm in letting her touch you a little? Where's the danger in letting her give you a kiss? It's not like you'll become hooked on her slime and have all your levels drained, is it?
A fantasy-themed audio roleplay where you are the daring hero, and I am the sweet, innocent slimegirl who definitely isn't trying to become more powerful by stroking you and then fucking your brains out!
