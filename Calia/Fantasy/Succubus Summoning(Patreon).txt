It's October, so of course it's time for the spooky files.
This is just the beginning. An interactive roleplay experience where you hear the voice of a succubus from beyond our world, and she wants you to bring her here... you'll help her won't you?
Because she offers nothing but pleasure in return.
Prepare three candles and a lighter or matches before you listen. Draw a salt circle around yourself for the full effect, and keep the lights dim. See you on the other side.
