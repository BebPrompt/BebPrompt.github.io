You're on a date with me in a lovely restaurant, at a swanky hotel, but you're so tired. Was it the long day, or is it something about what I'm saying, how I look, how I make you want to come up to my room. And when you do nod off and find yourself bound in my bedroom, is it real, or just a wonderful, erotic dream? Ready to let me have my way with you?
