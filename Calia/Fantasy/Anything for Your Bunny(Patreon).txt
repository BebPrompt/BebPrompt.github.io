You've adopted a new pet, a pretty and cute and adorable bunnygirl! She's so excited to come home with you, and she wants to let you know all about how to care for her. Bunnies have a lot of needs, like bedding and food and warmth and delicious carrots, so it's really important you do everything you can do look after her.
You do want to look after her don't you? You want to be a good owner for your bunny. So you'd do anything for bunny, isn't that right?
