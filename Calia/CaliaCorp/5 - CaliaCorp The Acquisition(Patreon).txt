In the first of CaliaCorp 2's six files, you find yourself as the company owner meeting with Calia to discuss a buyout, but as you listen to her offer, can you resist falling under her spell, or will you become another mindless drone in her corporate empire?
This uses an induction technique I haven't tried before, so if it's effective for you, let me know! The style used here is echoed in more of this series, so make sure you listen to this first.
