You've got a date tonight.
She's a little awkward, and kind of weird, but you've finally agreed to go on a date with her. She tells you all about her job as a mesmerizer, and even lets you in on some of her trade secrets. It makes for a very, very relaxing meal... and maybe she's not so weird after all... Maybe she's the girl of your dreams?
Part one of a four part series to be released through November! This file will introduce new triggers, and bring you into a relaxing, light trance with a conversational induction.
